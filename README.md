Logistic Regression Analysis on Workforce Data from County of Santa Clara


This project aims to analyze workforce diversity among employees at County of Santa Clara. Using publicly available data from the SCC Open Data Portal, logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the odds of various racial groups being FTEs at the county.

Here are the steps I took to complete this project: 

1. Obtain publicly available data set from County of Santa Clara website: https://data.sccgov.org/Government/Equal-Employment-Opportunity/f5de-b3zv 

2. Upload dataset into R and use R code to format data
          
      Transform Employment Status column into binary variable and all other variables into binary or categorical variables
      Convert variables into numeric variables using as.numeric
          
3. Run logistic regression model
4. Interpret results
5. Write a summary of the results of the project in report format

My final report on this project can be accessed here:
